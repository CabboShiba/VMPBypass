This tool will allow you to bypass VMProtect .NET AntiDebugger. Made by Cabbo.

# How it works

Using HarmonyLib, it hooks "System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal.AllocHGlobal", used by VMProtect to check if you are running the protected assembly under a debugger.

The program has been tested with VMProtect 3.5.0 (Max settings).

# How to use it

Drop VMPBypass.exe in DNSpyEx. Choose the file to patch with, and press enter.
